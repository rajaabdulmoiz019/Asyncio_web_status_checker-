This project is a menu-based asynchronous website status checker built using Python, asyncio, and aiohttp. It allows users to manually enter website URLs and fetch their HTTP response status codes in a non-blocking and efficient way.

The application demonstrates how asynchronous programming improves performance compared to traditional synchronous requests, while also practicing modern Python features such as match-case statements and event loops.
